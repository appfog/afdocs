This is the content repository for [the AppFog Documentation site](http://docs.appfog.com). 

To contribute, simply create an issue on this repository, or fork, edit, and make a pull request. 

Each content file has [YAML front matter](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter) that contains metadata for the file. A sample file looks like this:

    ---
    title: "Example Title"
    weight: 2
    ---

    Body content goes here. 

The title is required, but the weight is optional. 

You can use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to write content.

Each directory has an "overview" file (index.markdown).
