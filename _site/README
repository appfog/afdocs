This is the repo for the PHP Fog Documentation site at http://docs.phpfog.com.

### [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)

The site is generated in [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), so [install that](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/install) first.

Then clone this repo and rename the file "_config.yml.example" to "_config.yml".

Jekyll is a static site generator. It converts the markdown files into a static site under the "_site" directory.

The markdown file structure is pretty straightforward and self-explanatory. You can make your changes, then test them by running the following command from the repo's root directory:

    $ jekyll --server

or:

    $ jekyll --server --auto

which will regenerate the site automatically whenever you make a change. 

Go to 0.0.0.0:4000 in your browser to see a live version. 

When you're done, add and commit your changes and make a pull request.
