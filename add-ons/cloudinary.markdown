[Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/) streamlines your web app's image manipulation needs. Cloudinary's cloud-based servers automate image uploading, resizing, cropping, optimizing, sprite generation and more.

Cloudinary is built using modern web development frameworks and leverages Amazon Web Services' (AWS) cloud-solutions. The resources are delivered from high-performance servers through Content Delivery Networks.

Resources are uploaded, managed, and transformed using Cloudinary's easy-to-use APIs. Image upload, processing, and delivery are done on Cloudinary's servers and automatically scale for handling high load and bursts of traffic.

### Install Cloudinary

In the "Add-ons" tab in your app console click "Install" for the Cloudinary add-on. That’s it!
