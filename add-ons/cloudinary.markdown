## Cloudinary

### Intro

[Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/) adds image manipulation functionality to your application, automating image uploading, resizing cropping, optimizing sprite generation and more. You can easily use Cloudinary’s APIs to upload, manage and transform images. Resources are then delivered from Cloudinary’s Content Delivery Networks automatically scaling to meet demand. 

### Why use Cloudinary

If you are used to using ImageMagick or other locally based image manipulation tools, but you require the same functionality and more in the cloud with AppFog.

### Install Cloudinary

In the [AppFog console](https://console.appfog.com/), select the application you wish to setup.
Navigate to the “Add-ons” tab and click “Install” for the Cloudinary add-on.

### Use Cloudinary

Installing Cloudinary automatically sets up an environment variable for your app named ‘CLOUDINARY_URL’ . This includes all Cloudinary login information and URI. 

### Cloudinary Management Console

From your app [console](https://console.appfog.com/) in the Add-ons tab, click “Manage” under Cloudinary, this will direct you to the Cloudinary management console.
