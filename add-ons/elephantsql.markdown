## ElephantSQL

[ElephantSQL](http://www.elephantsql.com) is a hosted [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) service. PostgreSQL is an advanced, fast, reliable and open source SQL server. ElephantSQL hosts PostgreSQL servers in EC2, close to where you're app is run, for lowest possible latency. Backup and disaster recovery is automatically enabled.

On your local machine install with ```brew install postgresql```.

### Connect to ElephantSQL/PostgreSQL

Installing the ElephantSQL add-on automatically sets an environment variable for your app called "`ELEPHANTSQL_URL`". Then follow any of the language guides on [ElephantSQL Docs](http://www.elephantsql.com/docs.html).

### ElephantSQL management interface

In the "Add-ons" tab in your app console, click on the "Manage" button for the ElephantSQL add-on.
