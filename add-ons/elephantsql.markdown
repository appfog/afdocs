### Why use ElephantSQL?

ElephantSQL can make sure you a have as large of a database as your application needs. With persistent storage backup and disaster recovery automatically enabled, never fret about your database’s safety.

Navigate to the “Add-ons” tab and click “Install” for the ElephantSQL add-on.

If you need to install PostgreSQL for local development see Additional Resources below.

### Use ElephantSQL

Installing the ElephantSQL add-on automatically sets an environment variable for your app call `ELEPHANTSQL_URL` . This variable includes the full URI including the hostname, database path, username, and password.
