## IronWorker

### Install IronWorker

In the "Add-ons" tab in your app console click "Install" for the IronWorker add-on. That's it!

### Integrate IronWorker

Just copy [IronWorker.class.php](https://github.com/iron-io/iron_worker_php/blob/master/IronWorker.class.php) and include it in your script:


    <?php
    require_once "IronWorker.class.php"

### Create a Worker

When you install IronWorker, the installer creates two environment variables set with the necessary credentials. Create a worker and pass in those credentials like this:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums:3 linenums"><code>$worker = new IronWorker(array(
'token' => getenv('IRON_WORKER_TOKEN'),
'project_id' => getenv('IRON_WORKER_PROJECT_ID')
));

</code></pre>

Here's an example worker:

    <?php
    echo "Hello PHP World!\n";

We'll call this worker "HelloWorld.php".

### Upload Your Worker

Here's how to take the example above, zip it up, and upload it to IronWorker.

    <?php
    # Zip single file:
    IronWorker::createZip(dirname(__FILE__), array('HelloWorld.php'), 'worker.zip', true);
    $res = $iw->postCode('HelloWorld.php', 'worker.zip', 'HelloWorld');

###  Queue Your Worker

    <?php
    $task_id = $iw->postTask('HelloWorld');

Your worker should start in a few seconds.

### Schedule Your Worker

If you want to run your code more than once or run it in regular intervals, you can schedule it:

    <?php
    # 3 minutes from now
    $start_at = time() + 3*60;

    # Run task every 2 minutes, repeat 10 times
    $iw->postScheduleAdvanced('HelloWorld', array(), $start_at, 2*60, null, 10);

### Check the Status of Your Worker

Use the `getTaskDetails()` method.

    <?php
    $task_id = $iw->postTask('HelloWorld');
    $details = $iw->getTaskDetails($task_id);

    echo $details->status; # prints 'queued', 'complete', 'error' etc.

### And More...

You can also pass payloads to your tasks, set progress status, logs, etc. For more information, check out some of these resources:
