### Install MongoHQ

In the "Add-ons" tab in your app console click "Install" for the MongoHQ add-on. That's it!

Installing the MongoHQ add-on automatically sets an environment variable for your app called "`MONGOHQ_URL`". You can access this in your code with `getenv(["MONGOHQ_URL")`. This variable includes the full URI including the hostname, database path, username and password. It looks like this: 

{: .prettyprint}
	mongodb://username:password@host:port/database

Using MongoDB from a PHP app is very easy. The required extensions are already installed on all servers, so you can use the Mongo objects from your app immediately. Here is a little sample app you can use to test out your newly created MongoDB:

{: .prettyprint .linenums}
	<?php
		// connect
		$m = new Mongo(getenv("MONGOLAB_URI"));
		
		// select a database
		$db = $m->comedy;
		
		// select a collection (analogous to a relational database's table)
		$collection = $db->cartoons;
		
		// add a record
		$obj = array( "title" => "Calvin and Hobbes", "author" => "Bill Watterson" );
		$collection->insert($obj);
		
		// add another record, with a different "shape"
		$obj = array( "title" => "XKCD", "online" => true );
		$collection->insert($obj);
		
		// find everything in the collection
		$cursor = $collection->find();
		
		// iterate through the results
		foreach ($cursor as $obj) {
		    echo $obj["title"] . "\n";
		}
	?>

You can find more information on using a MongoDB from a PHP app [here](http://php.net/manual/en/class.mongodb.php).

### MongoHQ Admin Panel

In the "Add-ons" tab in your app console, click on the "Manage" button for the MongoHQ add-on. This will take you to your MongoHQ account where you can make configuration changes and upgrade your MongoHQ account.
