* [Billing Cycle](#cycle)
* [Upgrades and Downgrades](#upgrades)

### Billing Cycle {#cycle}

Your billing cycle begins when you start your subscription. If you start your subscription on the first of the month, then your account will automatically renew on the first of each subsequent month. 

### Upgrades and Downgrades {#upgrades}

You can upgrade or downgrade your account by sending us an email at [support@appfog.com](mailto:support@appfog.com).

When you upgrade your service, your billing cycle remains the same, and you'll automatically be charged for the difference in plans for the rest of the billing cycle. For example, if you're on the $100/month plan and upgrade halfway through your billing cycle, you'll be charged $140 for the rest of the billing cycle, and then you'll be charged $380 at the beginning of the next billing cycle.

Similarly, when you downgrade, your billing cycle remains the same and you'll automatically be refunded the difference in plans for the rest of the billing cycle.
