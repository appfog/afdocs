## Billing

* [Billing Cycle](#cycle)
* [Upgrades and Downgrades](#upgrades)

### Billing Cycle {#cycle}

Your billing cycle begins when you start your subscription. If you start your subscription on the fifth of the month, then your account will automatically renew on the fifth of each subsequent month.

### Upgrades and Downgrades {#upgrades}

When you upgrade your service, your billing cycle remains the same, and you'll automatically be charged for the difference in plans for the rest of the billing cycle (to the nearest second). For example, if you're on the $100/month (Silver plan) and upgrade to the $380/month (Gold plan) halfway through your billing cycle, you'll be charged $140 for the rest of the billing cycle, and then you'll be charged $380 at the beginning of the next billing cycle.

When you downgrade your account will be given a pro-rated credit for the remaining unused portion of the previous level plan. Your new plan will be charged immediately, using up the remaining credit and charging your credit card if there is not enough left on that pro-rated credit. Any credits are used up with each billing and, once they are depleted, your credit card will be charged accordingly.
