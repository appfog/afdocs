PHP Fog does not support direct access to php.ini. However, the `AllowOverride` directive in php.ini is set to "`All`" which enables you to set the values of the directives in your .htaccess or in your PHP file via `ini_set()`.

### Setting Values `.htaccess`

Setting the value of a directive in `.htaccess` is easy. Simply place the following line of code in your `.htaccess` file, and insert the name and value of the directive you want to use:

{: .prettyprint}
    php_value <name> <value>

### Setting Values Using `ini_set()`

Please consult the [PHP manual on `ini_set()`](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php).
