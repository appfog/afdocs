## Getting Started

Getting started with AppFog is easy! Currently we are enhancing our automated sign-up process, but we are still doing sign-ups manually. So here's what you need to do:

1. If you would like an account, please contact support at [support.appfog.com](https://support.appfog.com).

2. Then [install our command line tool](/getting-started/af-cli)

3. [check out our Jumpstart apps](/getting-started/jumpstarts).

### That's it!
