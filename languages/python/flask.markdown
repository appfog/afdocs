## Python Flask

The following is a step-by-step guide to writing and deploying a "hello world" Python Flask app:

### Create the App

Create a directory for the app and change into it: 


    $ mkdir flask-example
    $ cd flask-example

### Prepare Your Environment

<!--- Create a `virtualenv` environment:


    $ virtualenv venv
    New python executable in venv/bin/python
    Installing setuptools............done.
    Installing pip...............done.

--->

Note: There is currently an issue with using `virtualenv` in an app directory, so we'll use a workaround. 


    $ mkdir ../flask-example-venv
    $ virtualenv ../flask-example-venv
    New python executable in ../flask-example-venv/bin/python
    Installing setuptools............done.
    Installing pip...............done.

Activate the environment:


    $ . ../flask-example-venv/bin/activate
    (flask-example-venv) $

Use `pip` to install Flask:


    (flask-example-venv) $ pip install Flask
    Downloading/unpacking Flask
    Downloading Flask-0.9.tar.gz (481Kb): 481Kb downloaded
    Running setup.py egg_info for package Flask
    Downloading/unpacking Werkzeug>=0.7 (from Flask)
    Downloading Werkzeug-0.8.3.tar.gz (1.1Mb): 1.1Mb downloaded
    Running setup.py egg_info for package Werkzeug
    Downloading/unpacking Jinja2>=2.4 (from Flask)
    Downloading Jinja2-2.6.tar.gz (389Kb): 389Kb downloaded
    Running setup.py egg_info for package Jinja2
    Installing collected packages: Flask, Werkzeug, Jinja2
    Running setup.py install for Flask
    Running setup.py install for Werkzeug
    Running setup.py install for Jinja2
    Successfully installed Flask Werkzeug Jinja2
    Cleaning up...

Create a file called `wsgi.py` with the following code: 


    from flask import Flask, Request, Response
    application = app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return 'Hello World!'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()

### Test Your App Locally


    (flask-example-venv) $ python wsgi.py
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

In another terminal:


    $ curl 127.0.0.1:5000
    Hello World!% 

### Prepare Your App for Deployment on AppFog

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following:


    flask==0.8

### Deploy to Appfog


    af push flask-example
    Would you like to deploy from the current directory? [Yn]:

    Detected a Python WSGI Application, is this correct? [Yn]:
    Application Deployed URL [flask-example.aws.af.cm]:
    Memory reservation (128M, 256M, 512M, 1G, 2G) [64M]:
    How many instances? [1]:
    Bind existing services to 'flask-example'? [yN]:
    Create services to bind to 'flask-example'? [yN]:
    Would you like to save this configuration? [yN]:

    Creating Application: OK
    Uploading Application:
        Checking for available resources: OK
        Processing resources: OK
        Packing application: OK
        Uploading (10M): OK
    Push Status: OK
    Staging Application 'flask-example': OK
    Starting Application 'flask-example': OK

### Test Your App on AppFog:


    $ curl flask-example.aws.af.cm
    Hello World!% 

### Connect Your App to Services

Now we'll connect Flask to a MongoDB service provided by AppFog.

### Bind Service

Use the `af create-service <service> <name> <app>` command to create the `mongodb` service and bind it in one step:


    $ af create-service mongodb mongo-example flask-example
    Creating Service: OK
    Binding Service [mongo-example]: OK
    Stopping Application 'flask-example': OK
    Staging Application 'flask-example': OK
    Starting Application 'flask-example': OK

### Add MongoDB Configuration

Your app now has a new `mongodb` service bound to it, but it's not using the service yet. Next, weâ€™ll configure the app to use the MongoDB connection information and credentials, both locally and on AppFog.

First, add this to `requirements.txt`:


    pymongo==2.1.1

Then add the following to the beginning of `wsgi.py`:


    import time
    import sys
    import os
    import json

And add the following to the end, right before `if __name__ == '__main__':`


    @app.route('/mongo')
    def mongotest():
        from pymongo import Connection
        uri = mongodb_uri()
        conn = Connection(uri)
        coll = conn.db['ts']
        coll.insert(dict(now=int(time.time())))
        last_few = [str(x['now']) for x in coll.find(sort=[("_id", -1)], limit=10)]
        body = "\n".join(last_few)
        return Response(body, content_type="text/plain;charset=UTF-8")

    def mongodb_uri():
        services = json.loads(os.getenv("VCAP_SERVICES", "{}"))
        if services:
            creds = services['mongodb-1.8'][0]['credentials']
            uri = "mongodb://%s:%s@%s:%d/%s" % (
                creds['username'],
                creds['password'],
                creds['hostname'],
                creds['port'],
                creds['db'])
            print >> sys.stderr, uri
            return uri
        else:
            uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017"

We also need to install `pymongo` for our local test:


    $ pip install pymongo
    Downloading/unpacking pymongo
    Downloading pymongo-2.2.1.tar.gz (230Kb): 230Kb downloaded
    Running setup.py egg_info for package pymongo

    Installing collected packages: pymongo
    Running setup.py install for pymongo
    ...
    Successfully installed pymongo
    Cleaning up...

### Test Your App Locally


    (flask-example-venv) $ python wsgi.py
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

In another terminal:


    $ curl 127.0.0.1:5000/mongo
    1342592886% 

### Deploy to AppFog


    $ af update flask-example
    Uploading Application:
        Checking for available resources: OK
        Processing resources: OK
        Packing application: OK
        Uploading (10M): OK
    Push Status: OK
    Stopping Application 'flask-example': OK
    Staging Application 'flask-example': OK
    Starting Application 'flask-example': OK

### Test Your App on AppFog


    $ curl flask-example.aws.af.cm/mongo
