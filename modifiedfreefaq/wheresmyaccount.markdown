## Where's My Account?

AppFog accounts were deleted during a push to remove inactive free users from our infrastructure in early May of 2014. We sent out several email to give users time to mark their account as active. If we didn't receive a reply about your account, it has since been deleted along with all associated applications.

Please contact [support](http://support@appfog.com) to free up your email address if you wish sign up for a new plan. We provide free 30-day trials for our customers that sign up for a Basic or Dev plan.
