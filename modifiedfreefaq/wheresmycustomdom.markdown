### What Happened to My Custom Domain?{#whathappened}

In the Summer of 2013, free plans were no longer allowed custom domains. But some applications on these free accounts still have functioning custom domains. As some of you are discovering, however, that is not always a permanent thing. Depending on what you do to your applications, this ability can and does go away, causing your custom domains to cease functioning.

### Why Do Some Free Accounts Still Have Custom Domains and Some Do Not?{#whystill}

As stated in the [previous section](#whathappened) above, if you have a free account with an active application that has custom domains set up, these custom domains may still be functional. The reason is because those accounts had the ability to add custom domains when they were first created, and they were set up that way prior to the changes put in place post-acquisition. Our system remembers how it was set up and keeps that configuration in place until a user makes any updates to the app. Once the application has been updated, then the system recognizes that the account is now longer allowed custom domains, and then those custom domain configurations are no longer functional.

But remember: Some of these custom domains are still working, and as long as the applications are not updated, they should continue to work just fine. The exception to this is those accounts who were using some older IPs which we had to change. Any custom domains set up on accounts that had those domains tied to the old IPs will no longer work.
