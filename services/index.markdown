## Services

When you provision and bind a service to your app, AppFog creates an environment variable called `VCAP_SERVICES`. 

This variable contains a JSON document with a list of all credentials and connection information for the bound services.

Here's an example that of the environment variable for an app that has two MySQL database services bound to it:

    {"mysql-5.1":[
        {
            "name":"mysql-4f700",
            "label":"mysql-5.1",
            "plan":"free",
            "tags":["mysql","mysql-5.1","relational"],
            "credentials":{
                "name":"d6d665aa69817406d8901cd145e05e3c6",
                "hostname":"mysql-node01.us-east-1.aws.af.cm",
                "host":"mysql-node01.us-east-1.aws.af.cm",
                "port":3306,
                "user":"uB7CoL4Hxv9Ny",
                "username":"uB7CoL4Hxv9Ny",
                "password":"pzAx0iaOp2yKB"
            }
        },
        {
            "name":"mysql-f1a13",
            "label":"mysql-5.1",
            "plan":"free",
            "tags":["mysql","mysql-5.1","relational"],
            "credentials":{
                "name":"db777ab9da32047d99dd6cdae3aafebda",
                "hostname":"mysql-node01.us-east-1.aws.af.cm",
                "host":"mysql-node01.us-east-1.aws.af.cm",
                "port":3306,
                "user":"uJHApvZF6JBqT",
                "username":"uJHApvZF6JBqT",
                "password":"p146KmfkqGYmi"
            }
        }
    ]}

You can use your app's language-specific facility to call the environment variable.

In Java:

    java.lang.System.getenv("VCAP_SERVICES")

In Ruby:

    ENV['VCAP_SERVICES']

In Javascript:

    process.env.VCAP_SERVICES

In Python:

    os.getenv("VCAP_SERVICES")

In PHP:

    getenv("VCAP_SERVICES")
